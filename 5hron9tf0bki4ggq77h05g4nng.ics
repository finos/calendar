SUMMARY:Product Control Common Template project
DESCRIPTION:Background \n\nSee https://github.com/finos/community/issues/
 97  [https://github.com/finos/community/issues/97]\n\nGoals\n\nThe Produc
 t Control Common Template initiative is looking to:\n\n\n\n * Construct a 
 common template data model using Legend Studio (an approved open sourced d
 ata modelling tool that allow users to\n   create data model in a graphica
 l user interface).\n * This common template data model will include all th
 e attributes that each vendor is required to run their valuation process a
 nd\n   return the consensus data to the banks.\n * Banks can connect their
  daily pricing data to the industry approved model for submission and vend
 or can leverage the same model\n   to provide the consensus data. Thereby\
 , both the banks and vendor will communicate in the same common model lang
 uage.\n\n\n\nAgenda: https://github.com/finos/finos-fo/issues?q=label%3Am
