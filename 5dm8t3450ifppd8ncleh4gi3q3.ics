SUMMARY:FDC3 Channels\, Feeds & Transactions Discussion group
DESCRIPTION:Background\nThere are currently 11 open issues in the FDC3 rep
 ository\, under consideration for the 2.0 release\, that relate to the exi
 sting\nconcept of channels (both the 'system channels' used via the desk
 top agent API\, and 'app channels' interacted with through the\nChannels A
 PI) and new concepts we've discussed introducing: transactions (a standa
 rdized way to make a request and receive a\nresponse back) and feeds (a 
 standardized way to request a stream of data\, such as a pricing stream).\
 nHence\, a Channels\, Feeds & Transactions discussion group has been propo
 sed. Learn more at https://github.com/finos/FDC3/issues/399\n\nAgenda\nht
